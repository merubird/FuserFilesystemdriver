How to build Fuser library


** Build Envrionment

You need WDK(Windows Driver Kit). You can get WDK through Microsoft Connect Web site for free.

** Build

When you unzip the fuser source codes, you can get the following folders.

    * \fuser (user-mode library fuser.dll)
    * \fuser_control (control program fuserctl.exe)
    * \fuser_mirror (sample program)
    * \fuser_mount (mount service mounter.exe)
    * \sys (driver fuser.sys) 

After installing WDK, launch the build environment from the Start menu. Change the directory to fuser source code.
Run "build /wcbg" command within each folders.


** Embed a manifest in programs

You may need to embed a manifest in fuserctrl.exe when you use Vista or Windows7. 
In that case, please run the following command within \fuser_mirror and \fuser_control directory.
"{PATH_TO_MT}\mt.exe" -manifest "fuserctl.exe.manifest"  -outputresource:"objchk_wlh_amd64\amd64\fuserctl.exe"
Please replace the target names besed on your environment.


** Install Driver

Now you can get binary programs for example under "\fuser\objchk_wlh_x86\i386".
You need fuser.dll fuser.sys fuserctl.exe mounter.exe mirror.exe

Copy fuser.sys under \Windows\system32\drivers
Copy fuser.dll under \Windows\system32
Place fuserctl.exe and mounter.exe in the same folder.

Run "fuserctl.exe /i a" This means register the driver and the service to Windows.
You can also do them separately.
"fuserctl.exe /i d" Install driver.
"fuserctl.exe /i s" install service.

If you update your driver, you MUST restart your computer after uninstalling previous version.


** Test the driver

You can get version information when you run "fuserctl.exe /v".


** Sample program

Run "mirror.exe /r c:\ /l m". This means mirror C driver under M driver. Can you see M driver?
To unmount M driver, run "fuserctl.exe /u m"
You can see all options of mirror.exe by running mirror.exe without argument.


** Uninstall Driver

"fuserctl.exe /r a" Uninstall both driver and service.
"fuserctl.exe /r d" Uninstall driver.
"fuserctl.exe /r s" Uninstall service.
You should restart your computer after uninstalling driver.


** For Windows Vista x64

You are required a code signing certification to install driver on Windows Vista x64.
You can disable driver signature enforcement using ReadyDriver Plus.

** Network filesystem/provider support

Fuser supports network filesystem mode. You need fuser network provider dll in \fuser_np.
Please build it and copy fusernp.dll into Windows\system32 directly.
You need to register network provider dll to system : fuserctl.exe /i n 
(Unregister network provider : fuserctl.exe /r n) 
You probably need to restart your computer after register or unregister network provider.
And try "mirror.exe /r root_path /l drive_letter /n". 
/n option means to mount as network drive 
Network filesystem mode is an experimental implementation and not tested well. 


** Windbg

You can debug the driver with Windbg. http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/Devtools/Debugging/default.mspx
You need to turn debug mode on. http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/driver/tips/Debug_Vista.mspx
